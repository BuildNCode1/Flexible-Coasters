# Flexible-Coasters
This is a PIP Flexible mesh that is used as a coaster. This is my very first type of mesh that I have made, and as such, the first variation that I designed in tinkercad had many errors and faults. The second variation was made in Autodesk's Fusion 360, and was much more accurate and easy to control than the first.
