# Flexible-Coasters
This is a PIP Flexible mesh that is used as a coaster. This is my very first type of mesh that I have made, and as such, the first variation that I designed in tinkercad had many errors and faults. The second variation was made in Autodesk's Fusion 360, and was much more accurate and easy to control than the first.
Here is a picture of the completed coaster:
